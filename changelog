v0.4 2014
 * Tried Fast forward differencing for cubic bezier, not worth
   the hassle
 * Further optimized decomposition of all primitives, less
   alocated memory.
 * After optimizing pixel writing, optimized pixel reading,
   yielding non-negligeable speed improvements.
 * Added an "immediate" module to avoid constructing
   a scene tree.
 * Allowing both IO & (ST s) as drawing monads, enabling
   interleaved drawing with io operations.
 * Added a "withPathOrientation" function to orient primitives
   on a path (allow to draw curved text)
 * Added toNewXBase transformation to create a new basis given
   a X axis vector.
 * Added a PathWalker module, to give access to the lower level
   path orientation facility.
 * Added some GHC rules for transformations

v0.3 June 2014
 * Switching main free monad type to the church encoded one.
 * Optimized the bezier decomposition, strictness annotations
   made wonders. May require forward differencing in the future.
 * Implementing specific decomposition for lines.
 * Reworked texture system, now allowing some specialized
   filler (hoping faster computation). For now only the
   solid color has been optimized, and all the transformed
   textures.
 * Fixing space leak in combineEdgeSamples, avoiding many
   allocations.
 * Adding bounding box calculation facility.
 * Exposing outline creation capability
 * Adding a skewX & skewY transformation function.
 * Fixing some numerical stability with the mitter join.

v0.2.1 April 2014
 * Fixing transparency in gradients.
 * Fixing alpha composition on top of translucent
   background.

v0.2 April 2014
 * Adding an ellipse helper.
 * Adding a polyline helper.
 * Adding a polygon helper.
 * Adding monoid instance for Drawing.
 * Fixing some stroking bug with cubic bezier curve.
 * Fixing some documentation snippets.
 * Adding a rounded rectangle helper.
 * Added a even-odd filling rule.
 * Added an offset for dashed stroking.
 * Added a transformation module.
 * Changed the Transformable typeclass, splitted
   it in two.
 * Added a dumping function for the constructed
   drawing.
 * Adding an image texture with bilinear filtering.
 * Adding an image helper.
 * Made some modest performance enhancements.

v0.1 February 2014
 * Initial version.
