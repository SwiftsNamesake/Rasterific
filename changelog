v0.3 2014
 * Switching main free monad type to the church encoded one.
 * Optimized the bezier decomposition, strictness annotations
   made wonders. May require forward differencing in the future.
 * Implementing specific decomposition for lines.
 * Reworked texture system, now allowing some specialized
   filler (hoping faster computation). For now only the
   solid color has been optimized, and all the transformed
   textures.

   allocations.
 * Adding bounding box calculation facility.
 * Exposing outline creation capability

v0.2.1 April 2014
